# 🎓 Student Productivity Dashboard

Welcome! This is a beginner-level student dashboard website that I’m building as part of my web development class. While the class is just starting, I’ve been exploring and adding a few extra features to practice and learn more.

- Stay motivated with quotes 💡

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
